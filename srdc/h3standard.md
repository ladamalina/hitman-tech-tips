## H3 Standard Category Banned Techniques/ Glitches
* Any trick that is not possible in current Hitman 3 patch is banned from Standard category (which can result in old submissions being moved to No Longer Possible Category)
  * More info on patches: https://hitruns-wiki.vercel.app/docs/h3_patch_notes#no-longer-possible-runs
* Tranq glitch is allowed for main boards, and currently banned for all other leadboards (Category extensions, Elusive Targets, Escalations)
* 24 hour in game timer overflow exploit is banned (Example: https://youtu.be/mJyyyYnrXlk?t=1529)
* Server/ disconnect glitch that results in target "death" without actually killing target is banned (Example: https://youtu.be/IZxoUftRYK8)
* Server warp/ teleport (Example: https://youtu.be/cW_8nXhbAHg) is banned on highly competitive individual level categories
* Resolution Stretch Glitch to teleport 47's gun (Example: https://youtu.be/MtBTkY3F4iM?t=14)
  * (This one works since 47 shoots based on where the camera is)

### Disclaimer/ Explanation
**This is not intended to be a "glitchless" nor a "no major glitches" ruleset.** It is banning a few specific glitches deemed harmful to competition by the community, based on community polls and discussion in the past. The reasoning for the banned glitches are given below:
* Although [downpatching is possible on PC (Steam and Epic)](https://hitruns-wiki.vercel.app/docs/downpatching), old patch tricks are banned in order to maintain accessibility to console platform players and to avoid splitting the playerbase between patches, among other reasons
* [Tranq glitch](https://youtu.be/KFrqJAM6vqI?t=8) is allowed for main boards, and currently banned for all other leadboards.  
  *  More in-depth explanation of tranq glitch: Sedate target with Kalmer dart gun/ sedative poison/ goldbrick proximity mine, then kill target with non-accident method and retain Silent Assassin rating even if body is found
  * Many players feel that tranq glitch cheapens the challenge of Silent Assassin too much, as it makes any kill a free Silent Assassin kill as long as you are able to find an angle to shoot the target with the tranq pistol.
  * In any case, tranq glitch is mostly obsolete, only being a potential timesave in Illusions of Grandeur SASO currently. It would have more implications for full-game consistency, if allowed again.
* The timer overflow exploit is banned due to the fact no one wants to watch a 24 hour video
* The server warp is banned for highly competitive categories because it is extremely random/ we don't know what causes it, and will kill competition if part of a WR strategy
* You can't see what the player is doing during the Resolution Stretch Glitch; in order to make the camera move enough, you have to make the resolution ridiculously stretched to the point almost nothing can be seen on screen. This makes it too easy for the player to use cheats while performing this glitch, without being able to see them doing so.
